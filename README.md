## Additional Notes
Our stories can be viewed in the Issues page. Their titles are of the format `#[ID] - [Story Points]: [Short Description of Story]`, and the stories themselves are of the standard story format.

To start attempting to implement a story, make a new branch using `git checkout -b story-[ID]` where you replace `[ID]` with the ID of the story. You can commit to this branch however you want, and when you think you are done, you can `git push` the branch and open a pull request that includes `Closes #[ID]` where `[ID]` is the ID of the story.
